### Advent of Code 2022

Welcome to my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) project! Advent of Code is an annual programming event where participants solve a series of challenges to unlock a holiday-themed story. This year, I decided to try something new and take on the challenge of using [V](https://github.com/vlang/v), a language I've never worked with before. My goal is to learn as much as I can while the event is ongoing and have some fun while I'm at it. Thanks for joining me on this journey!
